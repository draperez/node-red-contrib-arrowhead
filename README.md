## 2. Under development

The nodes are under development at this moment. Token validation node is missing for now.

## 3. Docker image to try it from the repository

You can test the module using docker and a node-red image.

This commands will remove (if exists) the old container, build a new image and run a new container with ```node-red-contrib-arrowhead``` installed.

- Remove old image:

```console
docker stop ah_node-red
docker rm ah_node-red
```

- Build image:

```console
docker build --tag ah_node-red:latest .
```

- Run:

```console
docker run --publish 1880:1880 --detach --name ah_node-red ah_node-red:latest
```

- It will be abailable at [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880).
